    <h1>Reading Response #1</h1>
    <p> Inspired by the Digital Gardens gif by Faith Holland, I became interested in exploring the realm of cybernetics via SZA’s music. Given that SZA’s “CTRL” album cover features her sitting in a field of old computer screens, I thought it would be interesting to create a search engine for SZA fans to explore her body of work visually. In doing so, I aim to provide a more in-depth analysis of “CTRL” and how it speaks to themes of love, heartbreak, fear of growing up, Blackness, womanhood, etc, all within the digital age.</p>

<p>This site’s functionality is minimal. The version I presented to the class just features a search bar, as well as a click-function that yields an embedded YouTube video, depending on what the user searches. There are a few adjustments I need to make to the final website, one being that I need to fix the search engine error that the user receives if they don’t type in a valid response. In addition to this, I need to add small notes to the sides of the website that provide more context to each SZA song, as well as make the navigation easier for people who are not familiar with SZA’s music (via providing a tracklist next to the search engine).</p>

<p>1. How can we ease the transition from being intimate online to being intimate in person (in terms of how we interact with friends)?

2. How can we fight social media addiction when our entire lives exist online?

3. Will there ever come a time when being online is the preferred method of interacting, and will this be a generational shift or will it be adapted by everyone? Furthermore, what would spark this change in preference?</p>

    <h1>Reading Response #2</h1>
<p>I found this week's reading to be relevant to today's world. Diana Nucera's presentation on digital justice and restoring disenfranchised communities was incredibly moving. To learn that 60% of Detroit's residents don't have access to a broadwidth connection was very upsetting, especially considering that Detroit is a predominantly Black city, which neighbors Flint, another predominantly Black city that has been experiencing a water crisis over the past several years.</p>
<p>This concept of digital justice is so important within the context of the pandemic, and I appreciate how these readings emphasize its importance and offer solutions to these pervasive problems. During the uprisings for racial justice this past summer, I learned about the concept of mutual aid – a topic that is touched on in the Virtual Care Lab, as well as the rest of the readings. Within the fight to create a better world, I hope that mutual aid becomes commonplace in the west. Our current individualist society has proven to be antithetical to a just society, especially during this pandemic. Since so much of the fight towards racial justice now happens in virtual spaces, it's equally important that we make sure everyone has access to these spaces. And in order for everyone to have access to these spaces, we need to evaluate the larger ecosystem of oppression within the world (which Nucera touched on in her presentation). All forms of oppresion are connected,</p>
<p>and to echo Fannie Lou Hamer, "nobody's free until everybody's free."
</p>
<p>1. As Digital Creators, how can we take our work / activism and get it seen by those who don't have access to online spaces?

2. What are protective measures we can take to prevent the infiltration of alt-righters in the online spaces of progressive organizers?

3. How can we take this concept of mutual aid and make it more visible within offline spaces (especially during the pandemic)?</p>

    <h1>Reading Response #3</h1>
<p>I found this week's readings to be interesting  – especially the cyberfeminism index. In IML 300, we learned a bit about cyberfeminism, but this reading gave me a clearer understanding of how it operates as an umbrella term, and isn't limited to the scope of technology or women, but is a framework of understanding within greater feminist movements across the world.</p>
<p>Cyberfeminism reminds me of the Riot Grrrl punk movement of the 90s in how it utilized the combination of feminism, punk music, and politics in order to make greater statements about oppression. Which leads me to the next reading on Data Feminism – I think it's very important to understand how intersectional feminism as a framework is necessary in the field of data / computer science. The section where D'Ignazio and Klein explain how data hardly ever "speaks for itself" reminds me of the question on racism in tech, and how, if biases go unchecked, technology that's meant to be "neutral" actually becomes biased.<p/>
<p>One example that comes to mind is the period in time when some soap dispensers would only recognize the skin tones of white individuals – leaving Black and brown individuals at a standstill. It's important to operate within the framework of intersectional feminism and cyberfeminism in order to create more ethical products in tech and data science.</p>
<p>1. How can we un-problematize this western concept of "open source" as students?

2. How can we ensure that data visualization is contextualized, and not simply letting data "speak for itself"?

3. Aesthetically speaking, the cyberfeminism index is stylized in an early internet/Y2K fashion. The amount of information was overwhelming for me and I wonder if it would be appropriate to redesign the website so it's more readable?</p>

    <h1>Reading Response #4</h1>
    <p>I found this week's reading on indigenous technologies to be very engaging. My first thought while reading the silver buffalo excerpt was how unfortunate it is that indigenous technologies aren't prioritized in our world's current discourse. Since so much of current technology aims to problem solve for the future, why aren't we instead looking to our past (and indigenous communities) for inspiration? During September 2020, I remember reading threads from indigenous people on Twitter regarding the forest fires in Southern California, and it completely changed my perspective on technology and how it's bred. From what I remember, this indigenous person created a thread on how fires in Southern California have always been a thing throughout history. However, the indigenous communities that live here already had in place methods to deal with the fires in ways that didn't impact the environment.</p>
<p>Given climate change's recent surge in importance, I think it's critical that we prioritize the methods and technologies of indigenous communities to protect our earth. This concept of "looking forward" should instead be replaced by looking backwards into how things can be done in the future, and I definitely think this realm of thinking should be mainstream in the field of technology. Overall, these readings reminded me of this concept and how it's relevant to our fields of being ethical media makers.</p>
  <p>1. What are ways that we can honor indigenous technologies in our every day lives?

2. How can we apply pressure to major tech companies to prioritize indigenous technologies?

3. Can design itself ever be fully decolonized under our current conditions of existence?</p>

    <h1>Reading Response #5</h1>
    <p>I found this week’s reading on Building Consentful Tech to be so interesting. I think it’s important that we, as a society, begin viewing consent in terms beyond sexual encounters, because it’s something that should be upheld but for some reason isn’t? Like the zine made me realize just how conditioned I’ve become to accept my data being stolen as a “normal” part of life, when it’s anything but. I think that it’s important to prioritize consent in the media we create, and this zine furthered my belief in how important it is to do so. Also, The New Organs website was so jarring yet effective. The presentation of it all, from the whispers of the narrator to the visuals, felt very personal.</p>
    <p>It makes the issue of consent in tech feel so much more dire than what it’s currently being branded as. I know with my group of friends we always joke about our cell phones “listening to us” after we see an advertisement for something we had just talked about, but after doing these readings, it freaks me out just how much information we actually provide to tech companies by accepting their terms and conditions. One change that I think should be advocated for is the implementation of accessible terms and conditions. Because honestly, hardly anyone has the time to read through the legal jargon of a digital contract. I believe that accessibility should be a part of the consentful tech conversation, and I hope that it gets better with time.</p>
<p>How can we incorporate tech consent into our curriculum?

Is there a way that we as consumers can fight back against the theft of our data?

Do you think that tech companies would be likely to make terms and conditions more accessible (readable), or would it not be in their best interest to do so?</p>

    <h1>Reading Response #6</h1>
    <p>This reading by Sasha Costanza helped me better understand design justice as a concept and how I can actually apply it to my personal work. As a designer, it’s commonly understood that design is meant to be about “problem solving,” but after learning about speculative design, I think it’s equally important to view design as a means of challenging hegemonic structures. I appreciate how this reading incorporated a lot of our previous readings on consentful tech and cyberfeminism – furthering the interconnectedness between all of these topics. What striked me the most about these readings was Costanza’s personal experiences with navigating spaces that weren’t designed for her, and the implications of that.</p>
    <p>I’d even argue that design justice goes beyond simply hiring designers from diverse backgrounds – it requires giving marginalized communities the tools they need to succeed in a world that wasn’t built for them. It requires a praxis of constantly challenging designs that actively “other” people, and not making it seem like it’s impossible to do so. Overall, I think this has been one of my favorite readings from the semester. I see myself pursuing a career in design and find this topic of design justice to be so fascinating (and applicable to my identity of being a queer person of color).</p>
<p>Exactly how much as individuals can we do to challenge hegemonic design in larger tech companies? And what would be required for us to fully shift company culture?

Design is an aspect of practically every field – how can we get more people to reckon with the concept of design justice and incorporate it into their respective fields?

I think it’s important to note the key differences between equality, equity, and justice (with justice being the removal of systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from succeeding in the first place). In terms of Design Justice, are there any groups or collectives that have a manifesto of sorts / strive to do tangible things to disrupt the current notion of design?</p>

    <h1>Reading Response #7</h1>
    <p>This reading actually opened my eyes to the world of cognitive differences, and how important it is to listen to the stories of those we don’t hear often. The TED Talk by Christine Sun Kim was so impactful for me. As a musician myself, I’ve always wondered how music is experienced by those with hearing impairments. Hearing Kim discuss the ways in which music can be consumed helped me understand how important it is to step out of my conditioned way of thinking. To tie this back to reading week 6, I think it’s important to view design as a means of challenging, not only just as a means of problem-solving or communicating.</p>
    <p>In these readings, I appreciate how the authors gave tangible examples of how designers can incorporate inclusive design into their work – from simply giving users agency in how they navigate online spaces. The bit by Brandon Gregory that discusses how moving objects in websites should have intention really resonated with me, because I cannot STAND when a website is super busy for no reason. I personally have attentive problems, so this reading actually reaffirmed me to let me know that I’m not the only one that has a hard time navigating sites, and it’s not my fault for doing so. Again, the onus should be put on designers to actively fix these problems so that online spaces can become more inclusive and accessible. Furthermore, these concepts of designing for cognitive differences extend beyond the digital realm – they should be applied to every field (online + offline).</p>
    <p>Are there any companies and/or websites that currently do a good job at critical accessibility?

How can we turn this concept of critical accessibility into something that’s standard?

Would the implementation of critical accessibility require policy? And if so, would it become politicized and/or would people become polarized on the topic?</p>
